Welp, Chrome was useless at generating a working application to suit my webmail needs, so why not to do it with Electron?

## Setup
1. Download / Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` and edit out your own URLs (the default URL is set in main.js)
3. Save your changes, open a terminal prompt and `npm run build` the shit out of this repo

Have a nice day :)
